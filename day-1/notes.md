#Day One Notes

###Markdown links are very easy! 

- **ACP**:
    - **Add**: git add .
    - **Commit**: git commit m-'comments here'
        - Using double quotes and a bang (!) sends you to scary Q world, cmd+C to use escape rope!
    - **Push**: git push


 ##GIT WORKFLOW:


 **Add (Staging)** >> **Commit (Saving)** >> **Push (Publishing/uploading)**

 - CMD+, to edit settings in VS Code
