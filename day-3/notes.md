Day 3 Notes



Arrow functions are used when passing another argument to a function call

Function call - 

Objects - 

Property - value, textContent, getElementById

Method - A property that is a function

	99% true: 
	* Properties are nouns - Descriptors - Talking about the thing
	* Methods are verbs - Actions - Turning the crank - Parenthesis - Yellow in VS Code/Eslint

Functions are like little machines that run code

* Define Function - Hey Browser, turn the crank whenever X changes
* Function is called by the browser when X changes

* App is a play
* DOM elements are actors
* We are the directors, giving instructions to the DOM

-> Get Properties
-> Add Methods to those properties

~Document Object Model~ - All element actors - All functionality within JS - JS interface 

~Defining a Function~ - Puts the machine together
VS.
~Calling a Function~ - Turns the machine on

> function shout(message) {
> return message.toUpperCase ();
> }
****Function named Shout** takes -message- and returns message as toUpperCase **

Module System - A structured way to pass functions from one file to another - Import a function into one file which has been exported from another 

> export function (-blahblah-,) {
> Function definition();
> }
> 
> import { -blahblah- } from ‘./fileWithExportedFunction.js’;

* VS Code by default won’t put the file extension so make sure to have your “.js” on file names
